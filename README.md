# GANs-Exercises
This repository is just a container of codes about "GANs" which I wrote in order to practice and understand generative adversarial networks.
The source of codes is mainly from
- GANs in action book
- https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN#gan
- https://github.com/marload/GANs-TensorFlow2
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/
